                 My Name is Ryan. I've always lived in the great state of Washington but moved to the West Side in my early 20's. I was in the Marine Corps between the years of 2011 - 2015 where I did one deployment to Afghanistan with an Infantry unit as a Communication Operator and another to Sana'a, Yemen where I got attached to a SOCOM unit. While at both locations, I continued to grow as far as my technology career goes which was always something new and exciting! When I got out, I had a great opportunity to work for Microsoft as a simple help desk technician. I quickly out grew that field and started writing applications for the company. I actually built the new hire on-boarding application which is currently being used world wide. It's now been re-done and vetted to fit company standards but it's something that I helped start from the ground up and that's always a great feeling!

                I really hope that this class can give me a different aspect about solving problems! One thing that I found about software engineering is that there is usually more than one way to solve a problem. This is what allows for a lot of cross communication and support from others. I know a wide variety of languages and frameworks from C++ and C# to Python and PowerShell. For everyone new getting into programming, a quick helpful advice that I'm sure others would agree, once you know one language rather well, everything else falls into place!
