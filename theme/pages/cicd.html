            The adoption of CI/CD has changed how developers and testers ship software. This blog is a first in a series of posts about this transition that will provide insights into different tools and process changes which can help developers be more successful with CI/CD. Dev approaches are always changing: first it was Waterfall, then it was Agile, and now its DevOps. This is how modern developers approach building great products. With the rise of DevOps has come the new methods of Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, (CI/CD) and Continuous Deployment.
                <br><br>

            <strong>What is CI/CD?</strong>
            <br><br>
            Conventional software development and delivery methods are rapidly becoming obsolete.
            In the Agile age, most companies would deploy/ship software in monthly, quarterly, bi-annual, or even annual releases (remember those days?). In the DevOps era, weekly, daily, and even multiple times a day deployments are the norm. With SaaS taking over the world, you can easily update applications on the fly without forcing customers to download new components. Often times, if your CI pipeline is working, they won’t even realize things have changed.  
                <br><br>


            Development teams have adapted to the shortened delivery cycles by embracing automation across their software delivery pipeline. Most teams have automated processes to check in code and deploy to new environments. This has been coupled with a focus on automating the testing process, but we’ll cover that in a future article. Today, we’ll cover CI/CD, what it is, and how modern software companies are using CI/CD tools to automate the process of shipping new code.  
         <br><br>


            Continuous integration (CI) focuses on blending the work products of individual developers together into a repository. This can be done several times each day, and the primary purpose is to enable early detection of integration bugs while also allowing for tighter cohesion and more development collaboration.
         <br><br>


            The aim of continuous delivery (CD) is to minimize the friction points that are inherent in the deployment or release processes. Typically, a team's implementation involves automating each of the steps for build deployments so that a safe code release can be done at any moment in time. Continuous deployment is a higher degree of automation, in which a build/deployment occurs automatically whenever a major change is made to the code.

         <br><br>

            Each of these stages is part of a delivery pipeline. In their book, Continuous Delivery: Reliable Software Releases through Build, Test, and Deployment Automation, Humble and Farley explain how every change to your software “goes through a complex process on its way to being released. That process involves building the software, followed by the progress of these builds through multiple stages of testing and deployment. This, in turn, requires collaboration between many individuals, and perhaps several teams. The deployment pipeline models this process, and its incarnation in a continuous integration and release management tool is what allows you to see and control the progress of each change as it moves from version control through various sets of tests and deployments to release to users.”
